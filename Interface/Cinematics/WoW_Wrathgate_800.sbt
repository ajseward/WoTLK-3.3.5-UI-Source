00:00:14:12 - 00:00:17:08
Highlord Bolvar! Thank the Light!

00:00:17:09 - 00:00:18:07
For Lordaeron!

00:00:18:08 - 00:00:19:11
For the Alliance!

00:00:29:05 - 00:00:30:21
Back, you mindless wretches!

00:00:38:12 - 00:00:40:06
Fight on, brothers!

00:00:49:00 - 00:00:50:16
Rise up, sons of the Horde!

00:00:50:18 - 00:00:53:04
Blood and glory await us!

00:00:59:00 - 00:01:02:07
Lok'tar ogar! For the Horde!

00:01:02:08 - 00:01:03:12
FOR THE HORDE!

00:01:03:15 - 00:01:06:04
I was wondering if you'd show up!

00:01:06:05 - 00:01:09:15
I couldn't let the Alliance have ALL the fun today!

00:01:20:20 - 00:01:24:12
Arthas! The blood of your father,

00:01:24:13 - 00:01:26:10
of your people,

00:01:26:11 - 00:01:28:22
demands justice!

00:01:28:23 - 00:01:31:15
Come forth, coward,

00:01:31:16 - 00:01:34:21
and answer for your crimes!

00:01:48:12 - 00:01:50:04
You speak of justice?

00:01:51:00 - 00:01:52:03
Of cowardice?

00:01:53:00 - 00:01:56:09
I will show you the justice of the grave

00:01:56:10 - 00:02:01:09
and the true meaning of fear.

00:02:01:10 - 00:02:05:05
Enough talk! Let it be finished!

00:02:18:00 - 00:02:23:05
You will pay for all the lives you've stolen, traitor.

00:02:23:06 - 00:02:27:15,
Boldly stated, but there is nothing you can--

00:02:30:00 - 00:02:31:10
What?

00:02:33:20 - 00:02:37:22
Did you think we had forgotten?

00:02:38:13 - 00:02:42:05
Did you think we had forgiven?

00:02:43:00 - 00:02:48:14
Behold, now, the terrible vengeance of the Forsaken!

00:02:48:15 - 00:02:49:14
Sylvanas...

00:02:52:00 - 00:02:56:09
Death to the Scourge! And death to the living!

00:02:59:00 - 00:03:00:19
Fall back!

00:03:16:00 - 00:03:20:11
This isn't over.

00:03:25:12 - 00:03:29:12
Now, all can see

00:03:29:13 - 00:03:34:04
this is the hour of the Forsaken.

00:03:38:00 - 00:03:39:03
We're finished.

00:03:40:00 - 00:03:41:02
No escape...

00:03:42:00 - 00:03:43:02
for any of us.
