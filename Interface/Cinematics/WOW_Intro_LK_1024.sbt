00:00:14:00 - 00:00:16:00
My son,

00:00:17:00 - 00:00:22:50
the day you were born, the very forests of Lordaeron whispered the name

00:00:26:00 - 00:00:27:50
Arthas.

00:01:12:00 - 00:01:14:00
My child,

00:01:15:00 - 00:01:19:50
I watched with pride as you grew into a weapon

00:01:21:00 - 00:01:23:00
of righteousness.

00:01:30:00 - 00:01:37:50
Remember, our line has always ruled with wisdom and strength.

00:01:39:50 - 00:01:46:00
And I know you will show restraint when exercising your great power.

00:02:38:00 - 00:02:39:50
But the truest victory, my son,

00:02:40:50 - 00:02:44:25
is stirring the hearts of your people.

00:02:52:00 - 00:02:53:50
I tell you this,

00:02:54:50 - 00:02:58:50
for when my days have come to an end,

00:03:00:00 - 00:03:02:50
you shall be king.
